GitHub recently streamed an announcement about having a built-in CI/CD in GitHub Actions. You can watch the event below:

I mentioned from my last [blog]({% post_url 2019-08-12-building-my-website-using-GitHub-Pages-and-Jekyll %}) that I will be sharing the steps I did to setup CI on this site. I will still do that, but with the above announcement from GitHub, I signed up for beta and if granted access, I will try using it for testing this site.

This feature will be generally available in November 13, 2019.
