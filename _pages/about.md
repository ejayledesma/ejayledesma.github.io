I am Ejay Ledesma, a Software Engineer from the Philippines. I currently work as a Software Engineer at [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/) under the Risk and Quant Analytics Engineering department and leads the Tools and Framework team. I have been with the company for over five years now. I also worked as an intern at FactSet as part of my undergraduate program.

I have been in the software industry for over five years and I am currently taking some time learning things out of the usual stuff at work. I feel that I am a bit late on this, but I look forward to learn new things and hopefully share them here as I learn and apply them.

When I'm not working, I usually find myself reading a book. I am also a sports enthusiast. Some of the sports I love watching are [basketball](https://www.nba.com/), [football](https://www.nfl.com/), motorsports like [formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/) and [formula e](https://www.fiaformulae.com/).

I recently got married to my lovely and supportive wife, Sarah. We love making memories by traveling the beautiful places of the Philippines and doing things together. We hope to start a family soon.
